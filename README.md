An Electronic Supplement to The Text of the Canterbury Tales
My project to digitize and transcribe John Manly and Edith Rickert's sixty thousand collation cards recording the textual history of the Canterbury Tales is completely funded by grants and scholarships. Digitization has been performed by the University of Oklahoma Digitization Lab, and transcription using Google Cloud API optical character recognition is in progress. Segmentation is being conducted with help from the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Oklahoma. The result of this project will be a web-based digital supplement that demystifies the process of textual editing, corrects the errors of Manly and Rickert's The Text of the Canterbury Tales, and facilitates new editions of Chaucerâ€™s work. Grant funding is provided by the Phi Kappa Phi Graduate Research Grant and the University of Oklahoma Graduate Student Senate Research Grant. The Hanna Holborn Gray Special Collections Research Center at the University of Chicago holds most of Manly and Rickert's collation cards. The portion presented on this website are currently housed by the Variorum Chaucer in Bizzell Library at the University of Oklahoma.
